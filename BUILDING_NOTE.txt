IMPORTANT NOTE: Windows Executable Build
================================================================================

The Video Manager application has been configured for compilation into a
Windows executable (.exe) using PyInstaller.

BUILD ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENT:
-------------------------------
To build a Windows .exe, you MUST build on a Windows system.

PyInstaller creates executables for the platform it runs on:
- Build on Windows → Windows .exe
- Build on Linux → Linux binary
- Build on Mac → Mac app bundle

Cross-compilation is not supported by PyInstaller.

BUILD CONFIGURATION COMPLETE:
------------------------------
All build files have been created and are ready to use:

✓ video_manager.spec       - PyInstaller configuration
✓ build.py                 - Python build script
✓ build.bat                - Windows batch script
✓ BUILD.md                 - Comprehensive build documentation
✓ BUILD_WINDOWS.md         - Quick Windows build guide
✓ requirements.txt         - Includes PyInstaller

TO BUILD THE EXECUTABLE:
------------------------
On a Windows machine with Python 3.8+ installed:

1. Clone or copy this repository to Windows
2. Open Command Prompt in the project directory
3. Run: build.bat
4. The executable will be created in: distribution/VideoManager.exe

ALTERNATIVE BUILD METHODS:
---------------------------
1. Manual build:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python build.py

2. Using PyInstaller directly:
   python -m PyInstaller --clean --noconfirm video_manager.spec

3. GitHub Actions (automated):
   See BUILD.md for CI/CD configuration

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT:
--------------------
This project was developed on Linux. To create the Windows executable,
transfer these files to a Windows system and run the build there.

The Python source code runs on any platform (Windows/Linux/Mac).
Only the .exe build is Windows-specific.

TESTING THE BUILD CONFIGURATION:
---------------------------------
The build configuration has been validated and should work correctly
when executed on Windows. The spec file includes:
- All required PyQt5 imports
- Proper data file handling
- Single-file executable configuration
- GUI-only mode (no console window)

FOR IMMEDIATE USE:
------------------
If you need to use the application right away without building:
   python run.py

This works on Windows, Linux, and Mac with Python installed.

DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS:
---------------------
1. Source code (cross-platform):
   - Users need Python 3.8+, PyQt5, Pillow, FFmpeg
   - Run with: python run.py

2. Windows executable (Windows only):
   - No Python needed on user's machine
   - Users still need FFmpeg installed
   - Larger download size (~100 MB)
   - Easier for non-technical users
